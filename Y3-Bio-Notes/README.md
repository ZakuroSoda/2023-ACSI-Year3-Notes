## Y3 Biology Essay Questions

### Common Mistakes

- Surface Area is not always TO VOLUME
- Graph must always quote data
- Label must always careful singular/plural

### Chapter 1: Cell Structure and Organisation

#### Essay 1.1: Modern Cell Theory

The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life; all organisms are composed of cells. All cells are produced by the division of preexisting cells (in other words, through reproduction). Each cell contains genetic material that is passed down during this process. All basic chemical and physiological functions -for example, repair, growth, movement, immunity, communication, and digestion -are carried out inside of cells. The activities of cells depends on the activities of subcellular structures within the cell(these subcellular structures include organelles, the plasma membrane, and, if present, the nucleus).

#### Essay 1.2: Endosymbiotic Theory

Infoldings in the plasma membrane of an ancestral prokaryote gave rise to endomembrane components, including a nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum. In a first endosymbiotic event,  the ancestral eukaryote consumed aerobic bacteria that evolved into mitochondria. This would become the modern heterotrophic eukaryote. In a second endosymbiotic event, the early eukaryote consumed photosynthetic bacteria that would evolve into chloroplasts. This would become the modern photosynthetic eukaryote.

#### Essay 1.3: Similarities and Differences of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells

#### Essay 1.4: Similarities and Differences of Animal and Plant Cells

#### Essay 1.5: Functions of every Eukaryotic Organelle

#### Essay 1.6: Fluid Mosaic Membrane and Embedded Proteins

#### Essay 1.7: Processes in the Golgi Apparatus
Vesicles transport substances within the cell. Small vesicles containing substances made by the ER are pinched off from the ER. Vesicles then fuse with the Golgi apparatus and release their contents into the Golgi apparatus. The substances made by the ER may be modified inside the Golgi apparatus. Secretory vesicles containing these modified substances are pinched off from the Golgi apparatus. They then move to fuse with the cell surface membrane. Secretory vesicles fuse with the cell surface membrane and their contents are released outside the cell.

### Chapter 2: Movement of Substances

#### Essay 2.1: Definitions of Transport, Similarities and Differences
Diffusion is the net passive movement of molecules or ions from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration down a concentration gradient.  
Osmosis is the net passive movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential across a partially permeable membrane.  
Both diffusion and osmosis are passive (no respiratory energy required), and both are movement of substances down a concentration gradient. Diffusion requires to any gaseous or liquid substance and a membrane is not required, why osmosis only refers to water and takes place across a partially permeable membrane.

#### Essay 2.2: Factors Affecting Diffusion/Osmosis
- Mass: Smaller particles are faster, lighter particles are faster  
- Distance: Thin membrane, shorter distance (between two regions)  
- Temperature: Kinetic Energy
- Surface Area

#### Essay 2.3: Osmosis in Cells
Animal Cell, Hypotonic: Cytoplasm has a lower W.P than outside solution, so there is a greater net movement of water from the solution of higher W.P into the cell by osmosis across a partially permeable cell membrane. As water enters the cell, the cell swells as it does not have a cell wall to protect it. The cell eventually bursts (lyses).  

Animal Cell, Hypertonic: Cytoplasm has a higher W.P than outside solution, so there is a greater net movement of water from the cytoplasm of higher W.P to the outside solution by osmosis across a partially permeable cell membrane. As the cell loses water, it shrinks in size (crenation is said to occur when little spikes appear on the cell surface membrane). Cell is dehydrated and eventually dies.  

Plant Cell, Hypotonic: Cell sap in vacuole has a lower W.P than outside solution, so there is a greater net movement of water from the solution of higher W.P into the cell by osmosis across a partially permeable cell membrane. As water enters the cell, the vacuole increases in size and presses cell contents against the inflexible cell wall. The cell is turgid. (Cell wall prevents cell from bursting by exerting an opposing pressure as water enters the cell, stopping over-expansion.)

Plant Cell: Hypertonic: Cell sap in vacuole has a higher W.P than the outside solution,  so there is a greater net movement of water from the vacuole of higher W.P to the outside solution by osmosis across a partially permeable cell membrane. As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size, decreasing turgor pressure. The shrinkage of cell membrane and cytoplasm from the cell wall is known as plasmolysis.  

#### Essay 2.4: Facilitated Diffusion and Active Transport
Facilitated diffusion is the passive movement of large molecules and ions (bound to carrier proteins) across a biological cell membrane facilitated by protein channels or carriers down a concentration gradient. Channel proteins has a chanel through which solutes can pass, while carrier proteins undergo conformational changes (without the need of energy upon substrate attachment) to move a solution across the membrane as the protein shape changes.  

(Extra: Channel proteins open up spaces known as pores which are lined with polar groups allowing charged ions to pass, which are usually specific.)

Factors affecting: Same as diffusion.

Active transport is the active movement of molecular or ionic substances across a cell membrane against a concentration gradient with the use of respiratory energy. The molecule/ion combines with a specific carrier protein, and ATP is used to bring about conformational change in the molecule.  

Direct active transport means directly pumping a particle against the concentration gradient, such as the NaK pump. Indirect active transport requires coupling the solute and ions (such as protons). The inward movement of protons down the concentration gradient provides the energy for solute to move against its concentration gradient.

Factors affecting: Temperature, Oxygen, Presence of Poisons.

#### Essay 2.5 Endocytosis and Exocytosis.
Endo means into the cell and exo means out of the cell, both are active, and require fusion of vesicles with cell membrane (contents ejected) or creation of vesicles from cell membrane which move inward (*receptor-mediated endocytosis, ligands). Endocytosis is split into solid and liquid, phagocytosis and pinocytosis respectively.

#### Essay 2.6 Examples of Transport:
- Simple Diffusion: Oxygen into the cell
- Osmosis: Movement of water in and out of cells
- Facilitated Diffusion: Glucose moving into cells
- Active Transport: NaK Pump, Uptake of nutrients by plant roots, Absorption of glucose and amino acids in villi of ileum, Synaptic nerve impulse transmission, muscle contractions, excretion of urea by kidney.
- Phagocytosis: White blood cell (neutrophil) and bacteria
- Pinocytosis: Uptake of nutrients by egg cells from follicles
- Exocytosis: Secretion of glucagon and insulin from alpha and beta cells in islets of langerhans.

#### Essay 2.7: Surface Area to Volume Ratio:
As a cell gets bigger, the SA:V ratio decreases due to volume increasing faster than surface area. Nutrients and essential substances must travel a longer distance to get where they are needed and are less able to diffuse across the membrane and get there fast enough. Waste materials and heat also build up as they cannot diffuse out fast enough. Cell cannot get nutrients in and wastes out fast enough.

As a cell gets smaller, the organelles cannot fit and function properly.

### Chapter 3A: Nutrients

####  Essay 3.1: Function of each Biological Molecule
Carbohydrates are split into monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. 

They provide energy, can be converted to amino acids and fats, are needed in nucleic acid (DNA, RNA), used for lubricants such as mucus, used for nectar in flowers. Polysaccharides in particular have storage and structural roles.

---

Lipids simply refer to hydrophobic substances. These include triglycerides/fats, phospholipids, and steroids.

Fats can be further divided into unsaturated and saturated. Unsaturated means got double bond, saturated don't have. Unsaturated generally liquid at room temperature because cannot tightly packed, considered more healthy (plant and fish). Most animal fats are saturated.

Got one type of unsaturated called trans (the other is cis). that is not good.

Lipids are used to store energy, insulation in marine mammals, absorption and transport of fat-soluble vitamins, part of cell membrane, reduce water loss from skin surfaces (oil glands in skin), cushions organs, contribute satiety and flavor to food. Steroids are used to form hormones.

---

Proteins are essentially (many) long chains of amino acids. Proteins can be split into primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Primary is just one long linear chain. Secondary is either beta pleated sheet or alpha helix. Tertiary is when alpha helix undergoes superimposed folding producing a ball-like/globular molecule. Quaternary is when you link multiple tertiary together.

Proteins are used to synthesise new protoplasm, for growth and repair or worn-out body cells. They form enzymes. They form some hormones. Form antibodies. Maintain fluid balance. Maintain pH balance. Protein should not be used for energy (calories).

---

Water is a medium where chemical reactions occur, is needed for transport (nutrients ileum to other parts, waste from cells to kidney, hormones from glands to body), is key component of protoplasm, lubricants in joints, digestive juices, blood, tissue fluid.

In animals, water helps in hydrolysis of food (digestion), regulate body temperature through sweating, produced in respiration. In plants, water is used for photosynthesis, used to keep turgidity, used for transport of mineral salts, transport of food.

Properties of water: universal solvent (polar), hydrogen bond cohesion, large surface tension, high specific heat capacity and latent heat of ..., greatest density at 4 degrees celsius.

#### Essay 3.2: Shape + Bonds

- Starch - long chain of straight bond
- Cellulose - long chain of slanted bond
- Chitin - cellulose but with amine groups

Fat Shape
- Fats = glycerol + 2-3 fatty acid/phosphate
- Steroid = 4 carbon rings (if there is hydroxyl it becomes a sterol)

Bonds 
- Glycosidic Bond (Sugar-sugar)
- Ester Bond (Hydroxyl in glycerol + Carboxyl in fatty acid)
- Peptide Bond (Amine + Carboxyl)

#### Essay 3.3: Food Tests
Screw this no one gives a shit

Some points:
- how to break up sucrose into reducing sugar: boil with acid, neutralise with alkaline
- benedicts test: they are all precipitate, but you only use this word when it is brick red
- biurets test: alkaline solution, drop by drop

- Benedict's Test: 2cm^3 test, 2cm^3 reagent, boil 2-3 mins
- Fat Test: 1 drop test, 2cm^3 ethanol, 2cm^3 water
- Biuret's Test: 2cm^3 test, 1cm^3 NaOH, 1% Copper (II) Sulfate DROP BY DROP.

### Chapter 3B: Enzymes

#### Essay 3.4: Characteristics of Enzymes

1. Speed up chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.
2. Required in minute amounts as they remain unchanged at the end of reactions, can be used over and over again, so a small amount can catalyse a large number of reactions.
3. Highly specific in their actions, since each chemical reaction is catalysed by a unique enzyme, specific due to their 3d-shapes (lock and key hypothesis).
4. Affected by temperature since enzymes have an optimum temperature at which they are most active. Enzyme activity increases as temperature rises, but decreases at high temperatures due to denaturation. Inactive at low temperatures.
5. Affected by pH due to weak hydrogen bonds that stabilise the enzyme. Some enzymes work best in slighty acidic or slightly alkaline solutions. Extreme changes in pH will destabilise and denature the enzyme.
6. Some catalyse reversible reactions, that can proceed both forward and backward. Some enzymes catalyse both until equilibrium is reached.
7. Some require coenzymes, which are non-protein organic compounds that bind to the enzyme before they can catalyse.

**Acronym: T-CRAMPS**  
T for temperature, C for Coezyme, R for reversible, A for Activation energy,  M for minute amounts, P for pH, S for specific.

#### Essay 3.5: Memorise Activation Energy Graph
Enzymes increase the rate of reaction by reducing the activation energy, the input of energy before the molecules react together. Enzymes do not affect the change in free energy (energy released as more new bonds are formed), they merely hasten reactions that would happen eventually.

#### Essay 3.6: Memorise Examples
- Bromelain (Pineapple protease)
- Papain (Papaya peptidase)
- Thrombin (Fibrinogen to Fibrin)
- Catalase (Hydrogen Peroxide)
- Peptinase (Fruit juice break down pectin)

#### Essay 3.7: Lock-and-Key Hypothesis vs Induced-Fit Hypothesis

#### Essay 3.8: Definition of Denaturation

Secondary and tertiary structures of proteins held together by weak hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Excessive heat or large change in pH disrupts these bonds, so the enzyme unfolds and loses its 3d conformation, loses precise shape of active site. This is irreversible.

#### Essay 3.9: Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

- Temperature

Memorise the rate of reaction against temperature graph: 
Near freezing point, enzymes are inactive. They will regain catalytic influence once temperature is restored. For every 10 degrees celsius, enzyme activity is doubled. As temperature increases, there is an increase in the kinetic energy of the enzyme and substrate molecules, causing more frequent effective collisions, more enzyme-substrate complexes formed. Until hit optimum, is the maximum rate of reaction. If temperature increased beyond optimum, rate of enzyme action decreases rapidly due to denaturation.

- pH

At optimum pH, the intramolecular bonds which maintain the tertiary structure of the enzymes are intact. Conformation of active site is most ideal for substrate bonding. Frequency of effective collision between enzyme and substrate is highest, resulting in greatest number of enzyme-substrate complexes formed per unit time. 

When H+ concentration changes, it alters the ionic charges on the basic and acidic groups on the side chains of amino acid residues on enzyme. Ionic bonding that maintains conformation is disrupted, stopping substrate binding. Within small changes, it is reversible. At extreme, causes denaturation.

- Enzyme Concentration

Increase until max, when substrate becomes limiting factor, not all enzymes can find substrate

- Substrate Concentration

At low substrate concentration, reaction rate is directly proportional to this.
As substrate concentration increases, more active sites are taken up, so increase drops off.
Maximum is hit when all active sites are filled, that is enzymes are limiting factor.

**Extra Note: To raise the maximum rate of reaction, you need to increase ENZYME, not SUBSTRATE.**

- Activators
- Inhibitors

Competitive inhibitors such as sildenafil (viagra) bind to the active site, bear a close structural resemblance to the substrate.

Non-competitive inhibitors such as cyanide bind to other regions on the enzyme, and bear no structural resemblance to the substrate.

Competitive inhibitors can be overcome by increasing substrate concentration, because then the substrates can chope the active site first. Non-competitive inhibitors cannot be overcome by doing this, because it will still bind regardless of whether a substrate is attached, rendering the enzyme useless.

Hence, competitive inhibitors make it harder to reach max, but the max does not change. Non competitive inhibitors lower the max.

Functions:
1. Mix
2. Move

#### Essay 4.3: Physical vs Chemical Digestion
Physical is generally only in mouth (chewing, mucin) and stomach (churning), and duodenum (bile).  
Chemical is everywhere else (except oesophagus).

Physical is the mechanical breakup of food into small particles. Function is to increases SA:V so that digestive enzymes can act more efficiently.  
Chemical digestion is the break down of LARGE, INSOLUBLE, COMPLEX molecules in food, such as proteins, carbohydrates and fats, into SMALL, SOLUBLE, SIMPLE substances that can be absorbed. Involves hydrolytic reaction catalysed by enzymes.  

#### Essay 4.4: Mouth/Buccal/Oral Cavity

**ACRONYM: HCLs** (Importance of Hydrochloric Acid):
- Helps to provide a suitable acidic medium for action of enzymes
- Convert inactive forms of prorennin and pepsinogen to active forms
- Lethal (kills) to germs in food.
- Stops action of salivary amylase

1 Physical, 2 Chemical

#### Essay 4.7: Duodenum

- Chyme entering stimulates secretion of intestinal juice from intestinal glands, pancreatic juice from pancreas, gallbladder to release bile

**Acronym: Pancreas - PALT**   
Pancreatic amylase, lipase, trypsin(ogen)

**Acronym: Intestinal Juice - SEEL**  
Sugar enzymes, Enterokinase, Erepsin, Lipase

Liver: Bile  

All these 3 are alkaline.

- Emulsification of fats: Bile salts lower the surface tension of fats, reduce the attractive forces between the fat molecules, causing the large fat globule to break into tiny fat globules suspended in water, forming an emulsion (of micelles). This increases SA:V of fats, speeding up digestion by lipase.

#### Essay 4.8: Absorption in Small Intestine
Fatty acids and glycerol can pass through epithelial cells cell membrane. (They go to golgi apparatus to get resynthesised into triglycerides and are then shipped off via exocytosis of chylomicrons). Generally diffusion.

Amino acids and sugars generally use active transport and diffusion to go through epithelial cells, then enter the blood capillaries. (They go to hepatic portal vein).

- Intestinal walls have many folds, on each fold there are many villi (little finger-like projections).
- On each villi, there are many epithelial cells around the lacteal and blood capillaries.
- Each epithelial cell has many microvilli on the receiving edge.

Adaptations for quick absorption:

1. No mixing of oxygenated blood with deoxygenated blood
2. Pressure difference (slow blood flow, sufficient time to be well oxygenated)(maintain high metabolic rate, send out nutrients and oxygen fast)

#### Essay 5.4: Difference in thickness
- Atria are thin: only forcing into ventricles, no need much pressure
- Ventricles are thick: out of heart, need pressure
- Right ventricle is thin: lungs is close to heart, less pressure and speed
- Left ventricle is THICKEST: whole body, need to generate large pressure and great speed, thick walls withstand and create higher pressure
- Median Septum is THICK: prevents mixing

#### Essay 5.5: How valves work
- AV valves point downward to permit easy flow from atria into ventricles
- Open when atrium pressure greater than ventricle
- Closed when ventricle pressure greater than atrium to prevent backflow of blood from ventricle into atria during ventricular systole
- Tricuspid: right side (no oxygen)
- Bicuspid/mitral: left side (oxygen)
- Chordae Tendineae are strong, fibrous connection that prevent cusps of AV valves from swinging back into atrial cavity during ventricular systole
---

Muscles help to constrict and dilate artery.
3. No valves, Got valves (semi-lunar type)
4. Small lumen vs Large lumen
5. Oxygenated vs deoxygenated

Movement in arteries is by the heart.
Movement in veins is by smooth muscle contractions, skeletal muscle contractions, and expansion of vena cava with inhalation (suction).

Adaptations of Capillaries
1. found between cells of almost all tissues
2. single thin layer of endothelium cells, quick diffusion
3. branch repeatedly for large surface area, quick diffusion
4. Bigger area, slow blood flow, low blood pressure, more time for diffusion

**Know how to draw: Artery is the only one with ELASTIC FIBRES, the rest is all just LUMEN and WALL**

#### Essay 5.11: Constituents of Blood
55% of blood is plasma, the other 45% is RBC, WBC and platelets.  

90% of plasma is water, the other 10% is dissolved bullshit like soluble proteins/amino acids, mineral salts, food, excretor products, hormones.  

RBC is erythrocyte, WBC is leukocyte, platelet is thrombocyte.  

RBC - Big fat cat - Biconcave Flattened Circular, role in BOTH O2 and CO2 transport   
Haemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin  
No nucleus, mitochondria  
Can turn bell-shaped to squeeze into capillaries  
Produced by bone marrow 
Lifespan of 3-4 months  
Destroyed in spleen, Iron stored in liver  

WBC - got five types, two categories (Lymphocyte (antibodies that destroy bacteria membrane or clump bacteria together for phagocytosis, they are not mobile), Phagocyte (mobile))  
WBC can also squeze through capillaries and enter tissue fluid.  
Lifespan of a few days.

Platelets are cell fragments that contain thrombokinase. When platelets or blood vessels are damaged, they release thrombokinase enzyme, which activates prothrombin (soluble) in plasma, into thrombin. Thrombin then links the fibrinogen proteins into one long insoluble strand of fibrin. The fibrin mesh traps blood cells, and forms a blood clot.


Conclusion:
3 ways blood protects itself: 
- phagocytosis
- antibody production (immunisation is possible)
- blood clotting (foreign particles stopped)

#### Essay 5.12: Blood Grouping System and Transfusion/Agglutination
Blood group A means RBC has A antigens and plasma has B antibodies.
Blood group B means RBC has B antigens and plasma has A antibodies.
Blood group AB means RBC has both A and B antigens and plasma has no antibodies.
Blood group O means RBC has no antigens and plasma has both A and B antibodies.

Since we only compare DONOR RBC to RECIPIENTS PLASMA (Donor plasma is diluted),
O is universal donor.
AB is universal recipient.

#### Essay 5.13: Interstitial fluid/Tissue fluid and Lymphatic System

High hydrostatic pressure at arteriole end forces plasma out through the gaps in capillaries. This liquid is called tissue fluid, surrounds all cells and tissues.

Diffusion is always from capillaries through fluid to the cell.

90% of fluid is reabsorbed due to osmotic pressure (more solutes in blood) at the venule end, but 10% enters microscopic lymph capillaries.

**Functions of lymphatic system:**
- Transport lymph back into blood: Lymph capillary, lymphatic vessel, afferent lymph vessel, lymph node, efferent lymph vessel, thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, subclavian veins, superior vena cava, right atria. This movement is dependent on valves an skeletal muscle contractions.
- Return plasma proteins back into blood to maintain osmotic pressure difference at venule end
- Lymph nodes act as filters for foreign particles and bacteria
- Absorption and transport of fat in chylomicrons from small intestine
- FLOW IS ALWAYS TO THE HEART

### Chapter 6: Respiration (Respiratory System)

#### Essay 6.1: The Basics

Breathing: The mechanical ventilating process that serves to supply the body with oxygen needed during respiration.  

Respiration: The oxidation of food substances with the release of energy inside cells.  

---

Aerobic/Anaerobic: Breakdown of food substances, in the presence/absence of oxygen, with the release of relatively large/small amounts of energy, with (carbon dioxide and water)/nothing released as waste product.

Aerobic occurs in cytoplasm AND mitochondria.

GLUCOSE + 6 OXYGEN = 6 CO2 + 6 WATER + MAX 38 ATP
^This is all you need to know for IP^  

Anaerobic occurs ONLY in cytoplasm.

GLUCOSE = 2 CH3CH2OH + 2 CO2  
Yeast does this (it can also do aerobic in presence of oxygen)

GLUCOSE => 2 C3H3O3-/H (PYRUVATE) => 2 C3H6O3 (LACTIC ACID)  
Muscles do this under OXYGEN DEBT during CONTINUOUS VIGOROUS muscle CONTRACTIONS.

Lactic acid fermentation is literally just glycolysis, then take the pyruvate and convert to lactic acid. So standard 2 ATP in 4 ATP out.

---

How is lactic cleared? During rest and recovery, increased breathing rate and depth provides sufficient oxygen to repay oxygen debt.

1. Lactic acid removed from muscles, brought to liver.
2. Liver oxidizes some to produce energy.
3. This energy is used to convert excess is reconverted to glucose in gluconeogenesis.
4. Glucose may be retransported to muscle and converted to glycogen.

   - Tar: Paralyses Cilia, Cancer causing
2. Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema
   - Epithelium lining airways become inflamed

   - Since cilia are paralysed, mucus and dust cannot be removed
   - Airways are blocked
   - Persistent cough trying to clear airway, lung infections
   - Over a long time, PERSISTENT and VIOLENT coughing lead to emphysema
   - Destruction of alveoli walls
   - Reduced surface area for gaseous exchange
   - Loss of lung elasticity
   - Wheezing
3. Smoking during Pregnancy
   - Narrowing of arteries, less nutrients reach fetus through placenta.
   - Less oxygen due to CO inhibition
   - Brain development, underweight, dead baby

### Chapter 7: Excretion

### Chapter 8A: Homeostasis

Maintenance of a relatively constant internal environment within a narrow range in an organism even when the external environment changes significantly.

Maintenance of what (Receptor, Control Centre, Effector)

1. Blood Plasma Water Potential (Osmoreceptors in Hypothalamus, Posterior Pituitary Gland, Kidney Tubules)
2. Blood Glucose Concentration (Islets of Langerhans, Alpha/Beta Cells, Liver/Muscles)
3. Temperature (Thermoreceptors in Hypothalamus, Hypothalamus, ACSGPLHM)
4. pH not tested
5. Adrenaline technically isn't homeostasis but it follows the same model (Sensory Neurones in Hypothalamus, Adrenal Medulla, PEACHES-V)

**Acronym: ACS-General Public License-HM** for Heat Loss/Gain

### Chapter 8B: Hormones

#### Essay 8.1: The Basic Definitions

A hormone is a:
1. Chemical substance
2. produced by an endocrine gland
3. in minute quantities
4. carried by blood
5. which alters the activity of one or more specific target organs
6. influences growth, development and activity of an organism
7. and is then destroyed by the liver.

^You MUST memorise the above.  

#### Essay 8.2: The Endocrine Glands

1. Hypothalamus - regulates the secretion of some pituitary hormone (it can also act as a receptor - osmo, thermo)
2. Pituitary Gland - usually receives hormones from hypothalamus and secretes hormones to control the functions of other glands
3. Thyroid Gland - thyroxine rate of metabolism and physical development 
4. Adrenal Gland - adrenaline
5. Pancreas - islets of langerhans alpha and beta cells
6. Ovaries - estrogen progesterone
7. Testes - testosterone

#### Essay 8.3: Diabetes Mellitus

- Body does not secrete enough insulin to control its BGC
- BGC reaches a level that exceeds the kidney's ability to reabsorb glucose so it is excreted in urine
- Muscle cells have no glycogen reserves, body grows weak and loses weight
- Body oxidises fats instead of glucose for energy, poisonous ketones produced
- ketones excreted in urine (ketonuria)

- Type 1: Islets of Langerhans do not produce sufficient insulin, treated by injection of insulin
- Type 2: Body cells develop resistance and do not respond well to insulin, treated by lifestyle changes, exercise, diet control

- Symptoms: Persistently high BGC, High GC in urine, Healing of wounds SLOW and DIFFICULT.

#### Essay 8.4: Effects of the Hormones (you learn)

**Insulin**:
1. Make cell membrane more permeable to glucose, increase rate of glucose uptake by cells
2. Increase oxidation of glucose in tissue respiration
3. Stimulate conversion of excessive glucose into glycogen for storage in liver and muscles (glycogenesis)

Effect: Decrease BGC
Too little: Diabetes
Too much: Shock

**Glucagon**:
1. Stimulate the conversion of glycogen into glucose in liver (glycogenolysis)
2. Stimulate the conversion of fats and amino acids into glucose (gluconeogenesis)
3. Stimulate the conversion of lactic acid into glucose (also gluconeogenesis)

*All in liver

Effect: Increase BGC
Too little: Hypoglycemia
Too much: Glucagonoma

**Adrenaline**:
Acronym: PEACHES-V

P: Pressure of Blood and Heartrate increases
E: Eye Pupil Dilate to ENHANCE VISION
A: Arterioles constrict to channel more blood to muscles
C: Coagulation rate of blood is increased
H: Hair Stands because hair erector muscle is contracted, causing goose pimples
E: Energy (more of it) is released due to increased metabolic rate
S: Sugar BGC is increased by speeding up glycogenolysis in liver and muscles
V: Ventilation rate and depth increased

The stimuli-controlcenter-effector part:
   1. Stimuli such as fear anger anxiety stress
   2. Stimuli activate sensory neurones in hypothalamus
   3. Nerve impulses sent to spinal cord
   4. Nerve impulses leave spinal cord to adrenal medulla
   5. Adrenal medulla produces epinephrine (adrenaline)
   6. Adrenaline carried in blood
   7. Reaches target organs around body, brings about **short term responses that prepare the body for flight or flight**.

#### Essay 8.5: Hormonal vs Nervous System

1. Stimulus and effector both present (hormone doesn't really have a control centre tho)

VS

1. Nerve Impulse (electrical signal) Vs Hormones (Chemical Substance)
2. Transmitted/Transported by Neurones/Blood
3. Quick/Slower
4. Voluntary or involuntary vs ALWAYS INVOLUNTARY
5. Localised vs One or more

### Chapter 8C: Nervous System & Human Eye

#### Essay 8.6: Stimulus to Effector

1. Stimulus
2. [Type] receptors in [Location] are stimulated.
3. Nerve impulses transmitted and travel through sensory neurone to grey matter of spinal cord.
4. In the spinal cord, nerve impulses are transmitted across a synapse to a relay neurone.
5. Relay neurones conduct impulses to brain (for decision/voluntary or FYI/involuntary)

**Involuntary**
- Relay neurone transmits across another synapse to the motor neurone.

**Voluntary**
- You can feel [sensation] when impulses reach brain, brain makes a decision.
- Brain transmits back down through relay neurone in spinal cord (white matter) to motor neurone.

**Ending of Both**
- Motor neurone then transmits the impulse to effector
- Effector [contracts etc]...
