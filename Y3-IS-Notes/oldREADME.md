# External influences on SEA during Ancient Period
## Indianisation
### Passive Absorbers:
1. **Historical/Mythological (Political)**  
    Indian ideas brought in through trade and interaction with Indians that Kaudinya threw a spear and it landed in Funan, so Funan people are proud of being under (descendants of) this famous prince and have an identity (part of a great big India)  

    A legitimate right to rule (no one can challenge the ruler's authority) bestowed upon them by Indian royalty, used Kaudinya mythology pictures to convince people to let them rule.  

    Lastly the rulers used Indian books to become better rulers.

2. **Social/Cultural**  
Funan stole Indian Language and Religion: Eg Angkor Wat: Hindu Shrine, Buddhist Temple, South Indian Architecture, Friezes and Art depicting Indian Religious Myths

3. **Economical**  
Funan depended and used India’s maritime trading and agriculture -> and hence minted its own silver coins. A clear copying of Indian systems. FYI the coin bore the images of aquatic fowls such as the swan.

### Active Engagers:
1. **Historical/Mythological (Political)**  
   Sri vijaya has a rival kingdom called Mataram.  
   Mataram split into two groups of Budhism and Hinduism and civil war.  
   Sri vijaya kills Hindus around year 1000 and thus Budhism becomes main religion in the region.  
   (Skip forward 200 years)
   Majapahit Empire exists now.  
   King wants to prevent a similar war which will tear apart his kingdom.  
   Pretends to be both Budha (peace symbol by donating a lot) and Shiva (destroyer by saying he is ascetic and has magical powers).  
   Makes everyone happy. (Shiva-Budhism Cult)

   India uses judge for trials.  
   SEA uses council of elders for trials (consensus).  
   Java FUSES into judge-arbitator who is assisted by a council of notables (something like facilitator).  

2. **Social/Cultural**  
    Indian temples are for public worship: Anyone can do celebrate/commemorate/hold events there.  

    Javanese temples are strictly for preserving the **royalty's** dignity: used to store the ashes of cremated Indianized deceased kings or royalty of Java. (Only royalty can enter)

    ---

    Prambanan (Javanese) Temple also used their own stories to create those inscribed friezes and stone designs.  
    The myth of `Roro Jonggrang` is told in the designs of the temple and it is sort of a tradition among the locals. Thus the Javanese people did not want to abandon their own ideas but tried to merge it (syncretisation).

3. **Trade (Economic)**  
    Indianized Javanese empires used coins that reflected their local heritage and lifestyle especially in internal trades.  
    Ancient Javanese gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons especially during the era of the Majapahit empire.  
    They created smaller denominations for easier everyday use.  
    The Funan inhabitants also incorporated their own local fowl, the crested argus, into their commercial activities to show that they possessed a distinct character of their own and that they were willing to innovate and adapt, not just absorb ideas blindly.
